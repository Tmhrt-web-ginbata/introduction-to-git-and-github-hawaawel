I signed up for GitHub by entering my username, email, and password, then verified my email to activate my account. After logging in, I created a new file by selecting Add file > Create new file, naming it, adding Markdown content, and saving it using Commit new file. I also set up a public repository to organize my work and explored its features to get familiar with GitHubâ€™s functionality.
